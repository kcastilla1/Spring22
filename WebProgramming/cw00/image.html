	<p>Blooper is just the best, man. I have had the pleasure of seeing him cheer the Braves on and keep the crowd entertained multiple times in-person at Truist Park in Cobb County. He doesn't stop there, though. Check out his Twitter, as he is a giant of a creature when it comes to sass and clapbacks, protecting the pride of the Atlanta Braves one tweet at a time. <br><em><b>Nothing gets past Bloop. Go Braves.</b></em></p>
