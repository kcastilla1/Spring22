	Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining presentation. Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear in a printed document.
